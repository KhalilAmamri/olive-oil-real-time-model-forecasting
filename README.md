## 🎯 Overview

This system provides end-to-end machine learning capabilities for forecasting olive oil production using:

- **Prophet**: Facebook's time series forecasting model for seasonal patterns
- **RandomForest**: Ensemble learning for complex feature interactions

The system supports two forecasting modes:

1. **Real-Time Forecasting**: Instant predictions based on user inputs via Streamlit UI
2. **Batch Forecasting**: Generate forecasts for extended periods and save to CSV

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of data loading, preprocessing, training, and forecasting
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful Streamlit interface with real-time visualizations
- ✅ **Dual Model Support**: Prophet for time series + RandomForest for multi-feature predictions

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
cd "c:\Learn Programming\MachineLearning\olive-oil-real-time-model-forecasting"
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Windows PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate (Windows CMD)
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Python 3.13 and Prophet

- The `requirements.txt` is updated for Python 3.13 compatibility.
- Prophet is optional and may not have Windows wheels for Python 3.13 yet.
- If you need Prophet, try installing it separately:

```powershell
# Optional: install Prophet (may require build tools)
pip install "prophet>=1.1.5" --no-build-isolation
```

If Prophet fails to install, you can still use the RandomForest workflow and all app features that depend on it. The Streamlit app and RandomForest model work without Prophet.

## 📖 Usage

### Training Models

Before using the forecasting system, you need to train the models:

#### Option 1: Using Python Script

```python
# Run in Python or Jupyter
from src.data_loader import load_raw_data
from src.preprocess import preprocess_data, prepare_prophet_data, prepare_ml_data
from src.model_train import train_prophet_model, train_rf_model, save_model

# 1. Load raw data
df = load_raw_data()
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} records")

# 2. Preprocess data
df_processed = preprocess_data(df)

# 3. Prepare data for Prophet
prophet_df = prepare_prophet_data(df_processed)

# 4. Train Prophet model
prophet_model = train_prophet_model(prophet_df)
save_model(prophet_model, "prophet_model.pkl")

# 5. Prepare data for RandomForest
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = prepare_ml_data(df_processed)

# 6. Train RandomForest model
rf_result = train_rf_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
save_model(rf_result['model'], "rf_model.pkl")

print("✓ Models trained and saved successfully!")
```

#### Option 2: Using Jupyter Notebooks

```powershell
jupyter notebook notebooks/03_training.ipynb
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook.

---

### Running Streamlit App

Once models are trained, launch the interactive dashboard:

```powershell
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

#### Features:

1. **🏠 Home Page**: Overview and documentation
2. **⚡ Real-Time Forecast**:
   - Select country, date, and features
   - Get instant predictions from both models
   - View interactive visualizations
3. **📊 Batch Forecast Viewer**:
   - View saved batch forecasts
   - Interactive charts and filtering
   - Download forecast CSVs

---

### Batch Forecasting

Generate forecasts for extended periods:

```python
from src.forecast_batch import run_batch_forecast

# Generate 12-month forecast
results_df = run_batch_forecast(
    model_type="prophet",        # or "rf"
    start_date="2026-01-01",
    periods=365,                 # number of days
    freq="D",                    # Daily frequency
    save_results=True
)

print(f"Generated {len(results_df)} predictions")
print(f"Saved to: data/forecasts/")
```

**Batch forecasts are automatically saved to:**

- `data/forecasts/batch_forecast_prophet_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- `data/forecasts/batch_forecast_latest.csv` (always points to most recent)

---

## 🤖 Models

### Prophet Model

**Type**: Time Series Forecasting  
**Best for**: Capturing seasonal patterns and trends

**How it works**:

- Decomposes time series into trend + seasonality + holidays
- Handles missing data automatically
- Provides uncertainty intervals (confidence bands)

**Training**:

```python
from src.model_train import train_prophet_model

model = train_prophet_model(prophet_data, seasonality_mode='multiplicative')
```

### RandomForest Model

**Type**: Ensemble Machine Learning  
**Best for**: Multi-feature predictions with complex interactions

**How it works**:

- Builds 200 decision trees on bootstrapped samples
- Each tree votes on the prediction
- Handles non-linear relationships automatically
- Provides feature importance

**Training**:

```python
from src.model_train import train_rf_model

rf_result = train_rf_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, n_estimators=200)
```

## 🎯 Real-Time vs Batch Forecasting

### Real-Time Forecasting

**What it is**:

- User provides inputs via UI
- Model generates prediction instantly (< 1 second)
- Result displayed immediately with charts

**Use cases**:

- Interactive what-if analysis
- Quick decision-making
- User-driven exploration
- Dashboard applications

**Example flow**:

```
User Input → Model Inference → Display Result
  (< 1 sec total)
```

### Batch Forecasting

**What it is**:

- Generate forecasts for many periods at once (e.g., full year)
- Process hundreds/thousands of predictions
- Save results to CSV files

**Use cases**:

- Monthly/quarterly business planning
- Long-term strategic decisions
- Automated reporting
- Stakeholder distribution

**Example flow**:

```
Define Parameters → Generate All Predictions → Save to CSV → Share File
  (runs periodically, e.g., weekly)
```

## 💡 Why Streamlit vs Power BI?

This project uses **Streamlit** instead of traditional BI tools like Power BI. Here's why:

### Streamlit Advantages

| Feature                   | Streamlit              | Power BI                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Python Integration**    | ✅ Native              | ❌ Limited (via Python visuals) |
| **ML Model Loading**      | ✅ Direct import       | ❌ Requires gateway/export      |
| **Real-Time Predictions** | ✅ Instant             | ❌ Slow (batch only)            |
| **Version Control**       | ✅ Git-friendly        | ❌ Binary files                 |
| **Deployment**            | ✅ Docker/Cloud easy   | ❌ Complex infrastructure       |
| **Cost**                  | ✅ Free & Open Source  | ❌ Licensing required           |
| **Customization**         | ✅ Full Python control | ❌ Limited to built-in features |
| **CI/CD Integration**     | ✅ Simple              | ❌ Difficult                    |

### Key Insight

Streamlit keeps **everything in Python**:

```
Data → Preprocessing → ML Models → Visualization → User Interaction
        ALL IN ONE CODEBASE
```

No need to:

- Export data to external tools
- Set up complex gateways
- Deal with licensing restrictions
- Maintain separate BI environments
